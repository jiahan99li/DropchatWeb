# Dropchat Web

 ### What is Dropchat?
 
 Dropchat is a project I completed. The main concept of this website is to program a Social Media, where users will be able to chat with friends and families and  also post some pictures or comments to share with their friends.
 
 ### What type of Programming Languages are used on this project?
 
 For this project I have used **HTML, Javascript and CSS** for the main look and design of the website, as for the backend of the Social Media, I used **MySQL Database** to store all the data from the users to later fetch or verify data using **PHP**.
 
 ### Is the website totally finished?
 
 The website as of now is fully usable, there are definitely many bugs and many areas where the code could be better written or other areas where it could be better optimized. My plan is to learn more knowledge on these kind of programs, and later on, keep improving my code as I learn new information.
 
 ### Is the website usable now?
 
 Yes, I have already hosted the website and it is usable. Click [this link](https://dropchat.chiahan.com) to test or view the result of the code.
 
 ### NOTE!
 **If accessing the website, I am also working on a smartphone application using the same data from this website, I made some changes to the database, so there may be some areas where some data will not be showing correctly.**
